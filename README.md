PDrum is a physical drum simulation that simulates the response of a vibrating membrane and a modal resonator to 
mimic the effects of a drumhead and drum shell. The simulation is based on the wave equation and uses a finite 
difference method to solve the equation in real-time. The simulation is designed to be efficient and accurate, allowing 
for real-time interaction with the drumhead and resonator.
